# sql-challenge

In this challenge, I researched the people who were employed by the company Pewlett Hackard in the 1980's and 1990's. 

All I had to go off of was a series of six csv files which described data concerning employees, departments, managers, salaries, and ttiles. 

I was tasked with designing tables to hold the data from this CSV files. After creating tables to act as frames to hold these data, I imported the CSV files into a SQL database to populate these tables. 

In creating these tables, I have created not only visualtions of the company data but also tools that I can further query to answer specific questions about the company staff during the 1980's and 1990's.

This challenge required me to employ methods in data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. 

The research questions I set out to answer are as follows:

(1) List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
(2) List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
(3) List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
(4) List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
(5) List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
(6) List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
(7) List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
(8) List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

The methods I used in this project include SQL, Jupyter Notebook, ERD, and Primary/Foreign Keys.
